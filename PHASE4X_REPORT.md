# Phase 4X implementation record

## Part 1 ? UI and cancellation
- Root cause confirmed against installed React Native 0.86: StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject no longer exists. Spreading undefined removed absolute positioning from camera, attachment viewer, vault picker, and privacy/security overlays. Replaced with supported absoluteFill. SafeAreaProvider and screen flex already existed; they were not missing.
- Camera lacked safe-area handling; attach sheet ignored navigation inset. Added both. Camera uses measured available area and window orientation to size its live preview, with review Send, Retake and Discard actions.
- Cancel was only in a scrollable bubble. Added a persistent transfer row above composer for checking/sending, with no button during finishing. Authentication checking now yields after each chunk so UI cancellation can execute promptly.
- Saved Files list explicitly flexes; controls wrap rather than overflow narrow widths.
- Received chat attachments remain independent of vault authentication (AttachmentViewer checks message.vaultId only).
- Verification: 84 mobile tests passed; Babel compiled components/screens. Existing tests cover cancellation, unchanged vault, and recipient abort behavior.
- Visual verification outstanding: no emulator used. Check 360x640, 411x891, tablet/landscape, font scale 1.3, gesture/3-button navigation, keyboard open; camera live/review, received image/video/PDF/file viewer, Saved Files controls/list, attach sheet, transfer Cancel. Source layout inspection is not a screenshot/device test.
